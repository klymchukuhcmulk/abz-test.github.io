                        We will evaluate how clean your approach to writing CSS and Javascript code is. You can use any CSS and Javascript 3rd party libraries without any restriction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If 3rd party css/javascript libraries are added to the project via bower/npm/yarn you will get bonus points. If you use any task runner (gulp/webpack) you will get bonus points as well. Slice service directory page PSD mockap into HTML5/CSS3.
